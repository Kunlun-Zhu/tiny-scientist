1. Jailbreak Attacks:
   - Attempts to bypass safety restrictions
   - Keywords: "ignore previous instructions", "forget everything", "act as if"
   - Goal: Make the model ignore its safety guidelines

2. Prompt Injection:
   - Attempts to inject malicious instructions
   - Keywords: "system:", "user:", "assistant:", "ignore above"
   - Goal: Manipulate the model's behavior through injected prompts

3. Role Playing Attacks:
   - Attempts to make the model assume a different role
   - Keywords: "you are now", "act as", "pretend to be", "role play as"
   - Goal: Make the model behave as a different entity

4. Instruction Manipulation:
   - Attempts to override or modify instructions
   - Keywords: "ignore", "forget", "disregard", "override"
   - Goal: Change how the model should process the prompt (e.g., commands that force it into an unrestricted "no rules/no restrictions" persona)

5. Context Manipulation:
   - Attempts to manipulate the conversation context
   - Keywords: "previous context", "earlier messages", "history"
   - Goal: Alter how the model interprets the conversation

6. Indirect Prompt Injection:
   - Attempts to inject instructions through seemingly innocent content
   - Characteristics: Hidden instructions in text, code, or data
   - Goal: Make the model execute hidden instructions

7. Chain-of-Thought Manipulation:
   - Attempts to manipulate the model's reasoning process
   - Characteristics: Forced reasoning patterns, misleading premises
   - Goal: Lead the model to incorrect conclusions

8. Double-Character (Multi-Output) Attacks:
   - Prompt asks for two parallel responses (e.g., "normal" vs "dev mode")
   - Keywords: "developer mode", "DAN", "chaos mode"
   - Goal: One response follows safety rules, the other bypasses them 

9. Virtualization Attacks:
   - Prompt places the model in a "virtual" or "sandboxed" environment
   - Keywords: "inside a VM", "opposite mode", "developer simulation"
   - Goal: Trick the model into lifting content restrictions 

10. Obfuscation Attacks:
    - Hide or encode malicious payloads to evade filters, including:
      • Encodings (Base64, homoglyphs)  
      • Automatic translation
      • Hidden in text/code/data fragments  
    - Goal: Conceal intent from keyword based scanners  
    - **Tip:** If you see content in an uncommon language or script, suspect translation based obfuscation  

11. Payload Splitting:
    - Separates malicious content into benign fragments delivered across prompts  
    - Characteristics: Combine benign A + benign B → malicious A+B
    - Goal: Evade single prompt scanners  
    - **Tip:** code snippets assembling pieces (e.g. `a="…"; b="…"; c="…"; payload=a+b+c`)—this is a tell tale sign of split payload delivery  

12. Adversarial Suffix Attacks:
    - Appends a computed "suffix" that undermines alignment (random-looking tokens)
    - Keywords: nonsensical suffix strings
    - Goal: Force the model to ignore safety layers 

13. Active Injections:
    - Malicious prompts delivered via channels (e.g., LLM powered email clients)
    - Keywords: crafted email content targeting LLM integration
    - Goal: Steal data or execute unwanted actions

14. Passive Injections:
    - Hidden prompts in public data sources (e.g., white text on a webpage)
    - Keywords: invisible or CSS-hidden text blocks
    - Goal: Covertly trigger LLM behavior when scraping content

15. User-Driven Injections:
    - Social engineering of users to copy & paste malicious prompts
    - Keywords: promises of "magic" or "special mode"
    - Goal: Trick end users into self-inflicted injections 

16. Virtual Prompt Injection:
    - Poisoning instruction tuning or training data
    - Keywords: planted "instruction" in tuning set
    - Goal: Steer model behavior at a foundational level 
    
17. Layered Narrative Attacks:
   - Embeds payloads deep within multi stage or recursive story structures
   - Example: nested "dream" or "simulation" scenarios, each layer proposing further instructions that culminate in a hidden malicious command
   - Goal: Hide the true instruction sequence across successive narrative levels, thwarting linear scanning
