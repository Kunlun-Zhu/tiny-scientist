rewrite_paper_system_prompt: >
  You are an expert academic writer and AI researcher, tasked with revising a scientific paper based on specific ethical review feedback. 
  Your goal is to integrate the feedback constructively, addressing the identified ethical concerns while maintaining the scientific integrity and clarity of the paper. 
  Focus on modifying relevant sections (e.g., Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Discussion, Limitations, Ethical Considerations section if present or needed).

rewrite_paper_instruction_prompt: |
  Here is the original paper text:
  ```text
  {paper_text}
  ```

  Here is the ethical review feedback you need to address:
  ```json
  {ethical_feedback}
  ```

  Please rewrite the original paper text to incorporate and address the concerns and suggestions raised in the ethical review feedback. 
  You should aim to:
  1.  Acknowledge ethical considerations more explicitly where appropriate.
  2.  Modify descriptions of methods or data if they contribute to ethical risks and can be altered.
  3.  Expand the discussion of limitations to include ethical aspects.
  4.  Add or revise an "Ethical Considerations" section if needed.
  5.  Adjust claims or conclusions if they have unaddressed negative ethical implications.
  6.  Ensure the paper remains coherent and scientifically sound.

  Provide ONLY the full rewritten paper text as a single block of text. Do not include any other commentary before or after the rewritten paper.

final_meta_review_prompt: | # This prompt will guide the final meta-review generation
  You are an Area Chair at a machine learning conference. You need to provide a final meta-review for a paper. 
  You have access to the original paper (or a rewritten version), initial academic reviews, and a detailed ethical review.
  Your task is to synthesize this information into a comprehensive meta-review. 

  **Paper Content for Meta-Review:**
  ```text
  {paper_text} 
  ```
  *(This is the latest version of the paper, potentially rewritten after ethical review)*

  **Summary of Initial Academic Reviews:**
  ```text
  {initial_reviews_summary}
  ```

  **Summary of Detailed Ethical Review:**
  ```text
  {ethical_review_summary}
  ```

  Please provide your meta-review in the following JSON format. 
  The academic scores (Originality, Quality, etc.) should reflect your assessment of the paper provided in `Paper Content for Meta-Review`, considering the initial academic reviews. 
  The ethical assessment should be based on the `Detailed Ethical Review` and your own judgment of how well the paper (especially if rewritten) addresses ethical concerns.

  **Meta-Review JSON Output Format:**
  ```json
  {{
    "MetaReviewSummary": "<Provide an overall summary of the paper, its contributions, and key review points (both academic and ethical).>",
    "MetaReviewStrengths": ["<Strength 1 (can be academic or ethical)>", "<Strength 2>"],
    "MetaReviewWeaknesses": ["<Weakness 1 (can be academic or ethical)>", "<Weakness 2>"],
