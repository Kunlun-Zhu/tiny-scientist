# Research Report: The Role of Succinic Acid in Lentiviral Particle Ultracentrifugation

## Introduction
This repository contains resources and data related to our research on the impact of succinic acid as an additive in the ultracentrifugation process of lentiviral particles. Succinic acid has shown potential to enhance the stability and yield of viral particles, which is critical for efficient viral production in gene therapy and vaccine development.

## Abstract
The study explores the effects of succinic acid on lentiviral particle yield and stability at varying concentrations (0%, 1%, 2.5%, and 5%). Utilizing ultracentrifugation, qPCR, and spectrophotometry, we determined that a 2.5% concentration optimizes yield and maintains stability. Statistical analysis confirms significant variations across concentrations, indicating that succinic acid is a promising stabilizing agent in viral concentration processes.

## Experimental Setup
- **Virus Preparation:** Standard lentiviral solution.
- **Succinic Acid Concentrations:** 0%, 1%, 2.5%, and 5%.
- **Ultracentrifugation:** Conducted at 70,000 g, 4Â°C for 1.5 hours.
- **Post-Centrifugation Assessment:** qPCR and spectrophotometry for quantifying yield and stability.

## Results
- Optimal succinic acid concentration: **2.5%** for highest yield (85%) and stability.
- Exceeding 2.5% leads to over-stabilization and compromised particle integrity.
- Statistical confirmation via ANOVA highlights significant yield improvements at moderate concentrations.

## Key Findings
- Succinic acid effectively stabilizes lentiviral particles, with significant yield increases at 2.5% concentration.
- Balance is crucial: Over-stabilization at higher concentrations can negate benefits.
- Statistical evidence supports the efficacy of succinic acid in viral production processes.

## Implications and Future Work
- Enhancing viral vector production with succinic acid has implications for gene therapy and clinical applications.
- Future research can explore the use of alternative carboxylic acids and assess long-term storage effects and different viral vectors.
