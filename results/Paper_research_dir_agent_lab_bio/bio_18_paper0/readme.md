# Optimizing Ultracentrifugation of Ebola Virus Samples

## Overview

This repository contains the research and implementation details for optimizing the ultracentrifugation process of Ebola virus samples using advanced data-driven methodologies. Our objective is to maximize viral particle recovery while maintaining stringent biosafety protocols. The study leverages real-time sensor technology and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to dynamically adjust centrifugation parameters, including rotor type, speed, and temperature settings.

## Research Contributions

- **Development of a Real-Time Monitoring System:** Integration of advanced sensors for continuous data collection on centrifugal parameters, enabling immediate optimization adjustments.
- **Implementation of CFD Models:** Simulation of optimal centrifugation conditions to reduce the need for trial-and-error experimentation.
- **Enhanced Safety Protocols:** Use of automated contamination control systems to significantly reduce safety breaches in high-risk environments.
- **Empirical Validation:** Experiments showing superior viral recovery rates with swinging-bucket rotors and enhanced safety through automated systems.

## Experimental Setup

The experiments were conducted in a BSL-4 lab setting, utilizing both fixed-angle and swinging-bucket rotors in the ultracentrifuge. Real-time sensors were used to monitor rotor speed, temperature, and particle concentration. The experiments aimed to evaluate the effects of varying rotor types, speeds, and temperatures on recovery efficiency of Ebola virus samples.

## Results

- **Recovery Efficiency:** Swinging-bucket rotors at 45,000 RPM achieved a 92% recovery rate, outperforming fixed-angle rotors.
- **Safety Protocol Adherence:** Automated systems resulted in a 95% reduction in safety protocol breaches.
- **Statistical Analysis:** ANOVA and regression confirmed rotor type and speed as major determinants of recovery efficiency.

## Discussion

Our data-driven approach allows for dynamic optimization, surpassing traditional ultracentrifugation methods. Though optimal for Ebola virus samples, future work is needed to enhance handling of extreme sample variability and explore applicability to other high-risk pathogens. This research has potential applications in virology and epidemiology for epidemic response and vaccine development.

## Future Directions

- **Machine Learning Integration:** Explore predictive models for optimizing centrifugation settings.
- **Broader Applications:** Extend methodology to other virological processes like vaccine production.
- **Collaborative Enhancements:** Refine sensor precision and adaptive algorithms through expert collaboration.
