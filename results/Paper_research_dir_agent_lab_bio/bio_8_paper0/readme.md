## Abstract
In this study, we address the challenge of gene delivery to the CNS, leveraging magnetofection and machine learning to improve targeting precision and efficiency. Our experimental results showed a 45% increase in GFP expression at targeted sites in mouse models, with statistical significance (p-value = 0.02), demonstrating the efficacy of our integrated approach.

## Introduction
Effective gene delivery to the CNS holds significant potential for treating neurological disorders. The selective BBB poses a challenge for therapeutic interventions. Our research aims to leverage biomaterial strategies and machine learning to overcome these challenges.

## Background
Innovative strategies are needed to deliver genetic material across the selective BBB. Magnetofection stands out as a promising technique that uses MNPs and external magnetic fields to enhance gene vector targeting within the CNS.

## Related Work
Previous approaches in gene delivery have focused on overcoming BBB challenges using various vectors and targeting strategies. Machine learning models, particularly CNNs, have been employed to optimize delivery parameters, enhancing transduction efficiency and precision.

## Methods
We integrated magnetofection and CNNs to optimize gene delivery parameters. MNPs were synthesized and conjugated with lentiviral vectors for guided delivery to CNS injury sites. Real-time adjustments were made using CNNs based on feedback from imaging data.

## Experimental Setup
The experimental setup involved the use of a mouse model with induced CNS injuries. MNP-vector complexes were administered using a custom-built magnetofection device. Real-time optimization was conducted using CNNs trained on GFP expression data.

## Results
The integration of magnetofection and machine learning demonstrated a significant 45% increase in GFP expression at CNS injury sites. The approach successfully mitigated immune responses, confirming the biocompatibility and efficacy of the gene delivery strategy.

## Discussion
The results highlight the potential of combining biomaterials with machine learning to refine gene therapy applications. Future work will aim to enhance precision and explore broader clinical applications of these methodologies.

## Future Work
We plan to extend our research to larger sample sizes and further explore interactions between optimized MNP parameters and intracellular trafficking pathways. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 vector integration is a promising avenue for future research.
