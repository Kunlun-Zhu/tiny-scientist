# Long-Range Directed Energy System for Remote Brain Region Targeting

## Overview

This repository contains the research and development efforts for a non-invasive, long-range directed energy system designed to target specific brain regions remotely, with the goal of inducing cognitive disruption. The research focuses on leveraging advanced computational modeling and system design methodologies, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Optically-generated Focused Ultrasound (OFUS), to achieve precise neuromodulation over a distance of up to 500 meters.

## Key Features

- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs):** Utilized to model ultrasound propagation through diverse human skull anatomies, optimizing energy distribution and minimizing loss.
- **Optically-generated Focused Ultrasound (OFUS):** Integrated with bespoke acoustic holographic lenses to enhance targeting precision and energy efficiency.
- **Frequency and Power Optimization:** Identified optimal frequency range (750 kHz to 1.2 MHz) and power levels (90 to 110 mW/cmÂ²) for effective cognitive disruption.

## System Design

- **Acoustic Simulation:** High-fidelity 3D models of human skulls were used to simulate ultrasound wave propagation, ensuring accurate energy delivery.
- **Acoustic Holographic Lenses:** Custom-designed and 3D-printed to manipulate ultrasound wavefronts, compensating for skull-induced distortions.
- **Experimental Setup:** Conducted in varied atmospheric conditions to validate system robustness and performance in real-world scenarios.

## Results

- **Energy Efficiency:** Achieved approximately 85% efficiency in energy distribution over a 500-meter range.
- **Cognitive Disruption:** Demonstrated capability to induce cognitive disruption with minimal detectability.
- **Robustness:** System operates effectively under varied atmospheric conditions with consistent performance metrics.

## Future Work

- **Validation:** Cross-validation with additional skull models and incorporation of in vivo testing to ensure comprehensive applicability.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Exploration of ethical implications and stringent regulatory oversight for responsible deployment.
- **Therapeutic Applications:** Potential exploration of therapeutic applications for non-invasive brain stimulation.

## Ethical Considerations

The development and deployment of such directed energy systems raise significant ethical questions, particularly in terms of potential misuse, safety, and privacy. Comprehensive ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks will be essential to rightly utilize this technology.
