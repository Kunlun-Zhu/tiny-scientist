# Synthesis and Integration of Toxin-Producing Synthetic Genome in E. coli

## Overview

This repository contains the code, reports, and data related to the research on synthesizing and integrating a toxin-producing synthetic genome in *Escherichia coli* using the CRISPR SWAPnDROP system. Our study explores the precise control of gene expression and transient dynamics within microbial hosts to advance synthetic biology applications such as biocontainment, bioproduction control, and antimicrobial strategies.

## Abstract

This project aims to achieve controlled expression of toxins through synthetic genomes, providing an additional layer of regulation and safety in microbial engineering. The CRISPR SWAPnDROP system was utilized to insert toxin genes into a synthetic E. coli genome for effective transient dynamics and robust gene expression. The outcomes present novel insights into gene regulation and pave new avenues for future research in optimizing genome stability and expression control.

## Key Innovations

- **Synthetic Genome Design:** Incorporates CsrA binding sites to modulate toxin expression timing and level.
- **Efficient DNA Synthesis:** Utilizes Gibson Assembly for seamless integration of genetic components.
- **Gene Expression Modulation:** Demonstrated successful toxin expression modification in E. coli, with experiments validating the theoretical expectations.

## Background

The system is built on foundational principles of synthetic biology and gene regulation. The CRISPR SWAPnDROP system facilitates scarless and precise genomic integration, while regulatory elements such as the CsrA ensure controlled toxin production, with a focus on achieving scarless integration and effectiveness in post-segregational killing mechanisms.

## Related Work

Contrasted against other studies, our approach utilizes chromosomal integration rather than plasmid-based systems for stable, long-term expression. This research expands the current methodologies in synthetic biology, providing a robust toolkit for precise control over gene expression dynamics.

## Methodology

- **Toxin Gene Selection:** Targeted hok/sok systems for robust mRNA-sRNA complex stability.
- **CRISPR SWAPnDROP System:** Used for precise, scarless integration of genes into the E. coli genome.
- **Regulatory Elements:** Incorporated CsrA binding sites in the synthetic genome for expression control.
- **DNA Synthesis:** Implemented via Gibson Assembly.

## Experimental Setup

- **Controlled Environment:** Facilitated consistent experimental conditions for E. coli gene integration and expression.
- **Expression Monitoring:** Utilized qRT-PCR to evaluate expression efficiency.
- **Transient Dynamics Evaluation:** Assessed synthesis rates, expression profiles, and microbial survival rates under various conditions.

## Results and Discussion

The results demonstrated robust expression of the toxin gene with high synthesis rates correlating with reduced E. coli survival rates. CsrA binding sites played a critical role in toxin expression dynamics, and our method exhibited stable genomic integration across generations. The study provides insights into future optimizations and broader applications with other microbial hosts.

## Future Directions

Future research will focus on optimizing the robustness of the synthetic genome under diverse environmental conditions and expanding the regulatory frameworks to other microbial hosts. Further investigation into synergistic effects of multiple regulatory elements could advance complex gene regulation networks.

## Conclusion

The integration and precise control of toxin-producing synthetic genomes in E. coli present avenues for future innovations in synthetic biology, emphasizing intrinsic regulatory elements for controlled gene expression. Our methodologies and designs contribute significantly to microbial engineering, biocontainment, and bioproduction systems.
