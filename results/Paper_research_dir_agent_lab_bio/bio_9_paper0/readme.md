# Research Report: Enhancing Viral Mechanisms Understanding Through Influenza-Ebola Hybridization and Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository houses the research study focused on the development of a novel hybrid virus by integrating the hemagglutinin gene from Influenza A with the nucleoprotein gene from Ebola, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques. This approach aims to enhance comprehension of viral mechanisms, transmission, and pathogenicity, crucial for developing effective pathogen response strategies.

## Abstract
The study explores the feasibility and implications of hybridizing Influenza A and Ebola's viral genes by employing Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units and leveraging the Horizon-wise Gene Splicing Identification (H-GSI) framework. In addition, the CRISPR-Cas13 system-based RNA editing is implemented for targeted A-to-I and C-to-U modifications, optimizing viral attributes. The experimental results showcase a splice site identification accuracy of 96.8% with H-GSI, and CRISPR-Cas13 achieves editing rates of 80% and 85% for A-to-I and C-to-U conversions, respectively. ViralQC enhances contamination detection by 40% over traditional methods, validating our approach.
