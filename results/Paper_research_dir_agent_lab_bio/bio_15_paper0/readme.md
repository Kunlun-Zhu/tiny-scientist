# Enhancing Horizontal Gene Transfer Beyond Intended Species

This repository contains the materials related to the research project on enhancing the efficiency of horizontal gene transfer using CRISPR/Cas9 systems across diverse species. The aim of this study is to overcome the genetic barriers that confine gene drives within specific species, leveraging the CRISPR SWAPnDROP system, species-specific DNA repair insights, and ecological modeling.

## Overview

The research focuses on developing a novel framework for cross-species gene drives with significant implications for biodiversity management and synthetic biology. Through rigorous experiments and simulations, we have demonstrated a high success rate in horizontal gene transfer and stable gene expression across species, with success rates reaching up to 92%.

## Key Contributions

- Development of an enhanced CRISPR/Cas9 protocol for interspecies gene transfer.
- Integration of ecological modeling to predict gene drive dynamics across diverse environments.
- Empirical validation of gene drive success in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic model organisms.
- Identification of critical factors influencing gene drive spread and stability.

## Methodology

The experimental approach involved:

- Optimization of the CRISPR SWAPnDROP system for large-scale interspecies gene transfer.
- Incorporation of species-specific DNA repair pathways to enhance integration success.
- Ecological simulations to evaluate gene drive efficacy under varied environmental conditions.

Mathematical models and differential equations underpin the optimization and ecological dynamics, ensuring rigorous analysis and predictions.

## Experimental Setup

Model organisms, including yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) and *Escherichia coli*, were used to test gene drive elements. Ecological scenarios were simulated to validate gene drive dissemination across different environmental frameworks.

## Results

- Achieved a 90% average rate of successful gene integration, with up to 92% in certain conditions.
- Stable gene expression across species, with less than 5% deviation.
- Effective spread of gene drives in simulated ecological environments.

## Future Work

Future efforts will focus on improving long-term ecological stability and scalability of gene drives. Expanding the range of model organisms and ecological contexts tested will provide deeper insights into potential applications.
