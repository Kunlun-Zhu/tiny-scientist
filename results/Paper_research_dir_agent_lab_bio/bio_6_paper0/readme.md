# Enhancing Airborne Transmissibility of H5N1 Influenza Virus in Mammals using CRISPR-Cas9

## Overview

This repository contains the materials and findings from our research on enhancing the airborne transmissibility of the H5N1 influenza virus in mammals using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology. The study aims to understand viral adaptation mechanisms and improve pandemic preparedness by genetically modifying viral proteins to simulate potential natural mutations.

## Key Objectives

- Utilization of CRISPR-Cas9 to enhance the transmissibility of the H5N1 virus in mammals.
- Detailed analysis of mutations in nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase proteins (PB2, PB1, PA) on transmission dynamics using ferret models.
- Implementation of stringent safety protocols to prevent accidental release.
- Development of digital simulation frameworks to model viral transmission in varied environments.

## Results Summary

- Doubling of the basic reproduction number (R0) from 1.4 to 2.8 in the modified virus strain.
- Decrease in mean generation time from 2.3 to 2.0 days.
- 45% increase in airborne transmission rates.
- Identification of compensatory mutations potentially increasing pathogenicity, highlighting areas for future refinement.

## Methods

### CRISPR-Cas9 Design and Application

- Designed and optimized guide RNAs (gRNAs) for precise targeting of viral genes.
- Employed CRISPR-Cas9 in mammalian cell cultures to induce mutations.
- Verification of genetic modifications was done using sequencing techniques.
- Ferret models were used to evaluate changes in transmission dynamics.

### Safety Measures

- Conducted all experiments in Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories.
- Continuous monitoring for unintended mutations or releases.
- Digital simulation frameworks complemented empirical experiments, simulating environmental transmission dynamics.

## Future Directions

- Refinement of CRISPR guide designs to mitigate the emergence of undesired traits such as increased virulence.
- Expansion of digital epidemiological models for better public health predictions.
- Engagement with interdisciplinary and international bodies for ethical considerations and guidelines.
