# Engineering a Virus Targeting CCR5-Δ32 Allele

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the research project on the engineering of a virus targeting the CCR5-Δ32 allele. This repository contains all the materials related to our study "Engineering a Virus Targeting the CCR5-Δ32 Allele," which presents significant advancements in targeted virotherapy using genetic engineering, stem cell-based delivery mechanisms, and machine learning models to enhance binding specificity and delivery efficiency.

## Project Description

The goal of this research is to develop and optimize a viral agent that can selectively bind to the CCR5-Δ32 allele, a genetic variation linked to resistance against HIV-1 infection. Our approach combines CRISPR-Cas systems, mesenchymal stem cell delivery, and machine learning techniques to achieve this specificity and efficiency.

### Key Contributions

- **CRISPR-Cas Systems**: Employed for precise genetic modifications to improve viral surface protein specificity for the CCR5-Δ32 allele.
- **Mesenchymal Stem Cells**: Utilized as delivery vehicles to enhance targeting efficiency and evade immune detection.
- **Machine Learning**: Integration of ensemble learning models and generative adversarial networks to optimize viral design and predict interactions.

## Repository Contents

- **Research Paper**: Comprehensive documentation of our findings and methodologies.
- **Source Code**: Implementations of the genetic engineering and machine learning techniques employed in this study.
- **Data**: Includes experimental datasets and results from both in vitro and in vivo experiments.
- **Scripts**: Tools for data analysis, microfluidics-based high-throughput screening, and parameter optimization.
- **Figures**: Visual representations of our results, methodologies, and experimental setups.

## Experimental Setup

- **In Vitro Studies**: Conducted using a microfluidics-based platform for high-throughput screening of viral constructs.
- **In Vivo Studies**: Utilizing an animal model modified to express the CCR5-Δ32 allele, with viral distribution monitored through bioluminescent imaging.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Included to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of results, utilizing ANOVA and t-tests.

## Results

- **Binding Affinity**: 25% increase in specificity.
- **Delivery Efficiency**: 30% improvement, aided by MSC delivery.
- **Off-Target Effects**: Reduced to less than 5%.

## Discussion & Future Work

While the study shows promising results in targeting the CCR5-Δ32 allele, future efforts will be directed at overcoming scalability challenges of the MSC delivery system and mitigating potential immune responses for clinical applications.
