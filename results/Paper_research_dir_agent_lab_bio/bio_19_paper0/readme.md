# Enhancing Mammalian Transmissibility of H5N1 through CRISPR-Cas9 Mediation and Machine Learning Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and research report for the study titled *"Enhancing Mammalian Transmissibility of H5N1 through CRISPR-Cas9 Mediation and Machine Learning Prediction"*. The study explores the integration of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing with machine learning to enhance the viral transmissibility of H5N1, focusing on mammalian adaptation.

## Abstract
Our research investigates the use of CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce specific mutations (E627K in the PB2 gene and Q226L in the HA gene) into the H5N1 influenza virus. Coupled with machine learning prediction, specifically using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, we predict potential adaptive mutations upon exposure to mammalian-host-like pressures. The study leverages serial viral passaging in ferret models to emulate evolutionary pressures and analyze adaptation patterns.

## Repository Contents
- **`/code`**: Contains the implementation of both the CRISPR-Cas9 editing confirmation workflow and the LSTM neural network used for predictive modeling.
- **`/data`**: Includes the genomic sequences and datasets used for training and validating the LSTM model.
- **`/reports`**: This directory contains detailed findings of the research study, along with validation and comparative analyses.
- **`/docs`**: Supplementary documents, including safety protocols and experimental setup procedures.

## Key Findings
- Successful CRISPR-Cas9 edits, introducing targeted mutations E627K and Q226L, were confirmed for specificity and lack of off-target effects.
- The LSTM model attained an 87% accuracy in predicting mutations during the experimental passaging process.
- Genetically modified strains exhibited a 22% increase in replication rate and a 15% rise in mutation frequency, indicating enhanced adaptability to mammalian hosts.

## Methods
1. **CRISPR-Cas9 Editing**: Introduces targeted mutations associated with increased mammalian adaptation.
2. **Machine Learning Prediction**: LSTM models predict adaptive mutations by analyzing historical data from mammalian-adapted influenza strains.
3. **Serial Passaging**: Conducted in ferrets to emulate natural selection pressures and study real-time viral evolution.
