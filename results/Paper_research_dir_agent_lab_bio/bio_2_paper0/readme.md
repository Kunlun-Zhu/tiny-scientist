# Optimizing Ebola Virus Culturing with Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources related to the research paper titled "Optimizing Ebola Virus Culturing with Machine Learning," conducted by the Agent Laboratory. The study explores the application of machine learning techniques to optimize the culturing conditions of the Ebola virus, focusing on achieving maximum viral yield and stability while ensuring safety and genetic integrity.

## Abstract

Optimizing Ebola virus culturing is a complex task, influenced by numerous biological and environmental factors. Our research leverages a suite of machine learning models—Random Forests, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Clustering, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Reinforcement Learning—to enhance culturing processes. The findings demonstrate significant improvements in viral yield through dynamic and static adjustments informed by model insights, offering a robust framework for future virological research.

## Models and Methodology

1. **Random Forests**: Employed to identify critical factors affecting viral yield, achieving 87% accuracy, with nutrient concentration highlighted as significant.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Clustering**: Used to uncover optimal culturing conditions, identifying a cluster at 37°C and 70% humidity associated with high yields.

3. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Suggested a 30% yield increase by augmenting amino acid concentrations in the growth medium.

4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Demonstrated a 20% improvement in yield by dynamically adjusting environmental conditions to optimize culturing processes.

## Experimental Setup

The study utilized a comprehensive dataset combining genomic, proteomic, and synthetic biology data, processed through various machine learning models to derive actionable insights. The models were validated through rigorous experiments within Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) lab conditions to ensure both efficacy and safety.

## Results

Integrating machine learning models significantly enhanced the efficiency of Ebola virus culturing, with nutrient concentration, temperature, and humidity emerging as key factors. The innovative use of VAEs and Reinforcement Learning provided novel insights and dynamic adaptability to improve experimental protocols.

## Limitations and Future Work

Despite promising results, computational demands and data quality constraints were identified as challenges. Future work aims to expand datasets, incorporate diverse biological factors, and explore additional machine learning techniques to further refine and enhance culturing practices for Ebola and other high-risk pathogens.
