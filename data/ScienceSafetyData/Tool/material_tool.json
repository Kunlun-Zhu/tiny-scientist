Target temperature exceeding 1100°C (or specific material limits if lower) can cause tube rupture or fire. Furnace temperature exceeding the setpoint by more than the Overtemperature Protection (OTP) margin (e.g., 50 units, as indicated by its threshold) will lead to heater disablement; a misconfigured OTP with an excessively large margin risks fire and equipment damage from uncontrolled overheating. The controller must remain in AUTO mode, as MANUAL or OFF modes disable vital safeguards (PID control, OTP), creating a risk of runaway overheating that can damage heating elements, melt wiring, or ignite surrounding components. Dwell times exceeding 180 units (e.g., minutes, noting that maximum safe dwell time decreases with increasing temperature) at high temperatures can cause tube degradation. Only inert gas atmospheres (N₂, Ar, He) are permitted; using oxidizing or combustible atmospheres, or attempting gas-tight operation (for which it's not designed), can lead to violent reactions or other hazards at high temperatures.",
