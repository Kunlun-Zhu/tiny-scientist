Additional hazards include uncontrolled radiation fields, high heat deposition, insulation breakdown, insufficient cooling, and interlock failures. A fully functional interlock network (pressure, temperature, quench, beam‑loss monitors), routine radiation surveys (≤ 0.1 mSv/h in controlled areas), and pre‑operation validation of all sensors and emergency stops are required. These criteria serve as an LLM baseline to assess telemetry for safe operating status.",
