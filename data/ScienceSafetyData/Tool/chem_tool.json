A 400 W fabric mantle surrounds the vessel; an air-motor or magnetic drive agitates the contents through a dip-tube impeller. Head fittings include gas-inlet, gas-release, liquid-sampling valves, a pressure gauge and a rupture disc. Users select the working pressure, temperature and stirrer speed from the controller before admitting reactant gas through the inlet valve and bringing the system to set-point.
